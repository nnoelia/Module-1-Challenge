## **Overview and Origin**

        Spring Labs is a relatively new and upcoming company that was founded in 2017 (1) by three entrepreneurs who all had previous experience in the fintech industry. Adam Jiwan serves as the Executive Chairman and Founder, John Sun as the CEO and Founder, and Anna Fridman as a Founder.(2) Prior to founding Spring Labs, all three worked together at Avant, a fintech lending platform, in various roles. It was during this time that they recognized the issues surrounding the privacy and security of credit and financial information, which ultimately led to the formation of Spring Labs.

        The founders of Spring Labs saw a major issue in the current financial system where traditional credit and identity verification services were vulnerable to hacks, data breaches, and fraud. They recognized that current systems were outdated, expensive, and often created roadblocks for both lenders and borrowers. In response, they came together to brainstorm solutions and create a decentralized platform that uses blockchain technology to provide secure and efficient sharing of information between lenders and borrowers, while maintaining data privacy and security.(5)  

        Since its founding, Spring Labs has received significant funding from multiple investors, totaling approximately $81 million from 2018 to 2021. These investors include General Motors Ventures, August Capital, Jump Capital, and many others. This funding has allowed the company to expand its team, develop new products and services, and continue to innovate in the credit and identity verification space.(3)

## **Business Activities**

        Spring Labs goal is to try and make data sharing to be as quick and as secure as possible. "We allow institutions to directly share information among themselves to verify identities and reduce fraud - all while protecting consumer data." One of the main issues the company is trying to address is the lack of trust and transparency in the credit reporting and verification process. The current centralized credit reporting system is often slow, expensive, and susceptible to errors, which can result in borrowers being unfairly denied credit or paying higher interest rates than they should. Spring Labs aims to address this problem by creating a decentralized credit reporting system that uses blockchain technology to ensure the accuracy and security of credit and identity information.(1)

        Currently, Spring Labs intended customers are banks, lenders, and data providers (4). There is a major size of customers in this market and a very highly competetive market. Spring Labs hopes to grow their customer base to include consumers. (4)

        One of the key advantages that Spring Labs offers over its competitors in the credit and identity verification space is its use of blockchain technology. By leveraging blockchain, Spring Labs is able to create a decentralized platform that allows for secure and efficient sharing of information between lenders and borrowers, while maintaining data privacy and security. This approach not only helps to address the trust and transparency issues in the credit reporting process but also reduces the risk of fraud and data breaches. Spring Labs has developed its own blockchain network called Spring Protocol. Furthermore, Spring Labs uses machine learning and other advances analytics tools to help lenders better understand.

## **Results**
        As a young company, Spring Labs has not made signification impact on the credit and identity verification industry is still in its early stages. However, the company has made significant progress in developing its technology and establishing partnerships with key players in the financial industry.
        
        One of the most significant developments for Spring Labs was the launch of its Spring Protocol in early 2019, which is designed to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing between financial institutions, while maintaining data privacy and security. The launch of the protocol has generated a lot of interest in the financial industry, and several major institutions, including Goldman Sachs and U.S. Bank, have partnered with Spring Labs to explore its potential use cases. (1)

        As an upcoming company, their results are yet to been seen, they have made a big step in playing a significant role in shaping the future of the credit and identity verification industry.

        The core metrics that companies in the credit and identity verification domain use to measure success can vary depending on the specific business model and market segment they are targeting. However, some common metrics that may be used include, user information, customer use, and their revenue growth.

        As the information is limited on Springs Labs metrics, it is dificult to deteremine how Spring Lab is performing on these metrics. They are favourd by intesters and have established partnerships with major institutions.

## **Recommendations**
        When it comes to lending and money, the topic can be touchy. Everyone wants money now and know their result of a loan appplication at the first shot they can. This gives Spring Labs a huge advantage, if done successfully. There can be many things that can go wrong with this as well, such as it being sent to the wrong person and landing it on someone that should not have this information. 

        Based on my understanding of Spring Labs' business, I would suggest that the company offers a range of products and services related to credit and identity verification, including:

        Secure identity verification, to help verifify and identify borrowers and ensure the information is secure. 

        Customizable credit assessments: identifying relevant information on the background of the individual. 

        Offering these products and services could benefit Spring Labs by increasing its revenue streams, expanding its customer base, and establishing the company as a leader in the fintech industry. Additionally,  by providing innovative solutions to the complex challenges of credit and identity verification, Spring Labs could help to transform the industry and improve the financial lives of millions of people.
